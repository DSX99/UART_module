UART_Custom.py is a module itself, testbences are inside, it passes them
UART_Custom_vibecoded.py is a try to make it work on FPGA, it goes all the way (synthesize, place and route, programmer) but the fact that i rewrite UART and need to communicate through this uart makes just it a hell, vibecoded as i have no idea how in other way i can make my uart take place of litex's one.

Other files are build results, idk will it make sense or not.
